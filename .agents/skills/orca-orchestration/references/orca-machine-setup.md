# Per-Machine Setup — The One-Time Checklist

## 1 · Install the binary and confirm the runtime

```bash
command -v orca                                  # the binary
orca status --json </dev/null | jq '.result.runtime'
#   want: state "ready", reachable true; note appVersion — the gotcha table is keyed to it
orca open --json </dev/null                      # if the runtime is not reachable
```

The gate this repo uses is `binary + reachable runtime`, never "is a vendor skill installed"
(`SKILL.md` §The gate). A machine with the binary and no stubs is fully capable.

**Gotcha (Linux)**: outside an Orca-managed terminal the CLI registers as `orca-ide`, because
`/usr/bin/orca` is the GNOME Orca screen reader. Run the gate with `command -v orca-ide` there
and use `orca-ide` for every later command; inside Orca's own terminals `orca` is correct.

Install instructions come from the vendor, not from here — this repo's installer lists the binary as
an OPTIONAL external CLI and reports its absence without ever failing
(`cli/install.ts`, the external-CLI table).

---

## 2 · Vendor skill stubs (optional)

```bash
orca skills list                                 # the bundled guide topics
orca skills install --skill orchestration --skill orca-cli --agent universal
orca skills installed
```

These are **optional and never required**. The stubs teach WHEN, not HOW; the grammar is served by
the binary on demand (`orca skills get <topic>`), which is what this repo's references ask for.
Install them if you want the user-level trigger words; skip them and nothing breaks.

Note `orca skills install --local` installs into the current project instead of globally. In THIS
repo, do not use `--local`: a stub landing inside the project skill store would show up as an
untracked skill directory and collide with the repo's own tier model. Global (the default) or
`--agent universal`, and nothing else.

## 3 · The two native-launch prerequisites

These two items decide whether **supervision** is available on this machine at all, so they are not
optional extras. The native launch (`worker-start --agent <agent> --model <id> --effort <level>`) is
the ONLY supervised one: the runtime recognizes only agents it started itself, so a terminal created
from our own command line can never be adopted (`references/gotchas.md` G44). A machine that has not
done both items below can still run a fleet, but every worker on it is unsupervised.

### 3.1 · The agent's default arguments (permission mode)

The native path accepts a model and an effort level and **nothing else**: there is no argument
passthrough on `worker-start` or on `worktree create`, so a permission mode cannot be expressed as a
flag. It has to be a per-agent default configured in the app:

1. Open the app's Settings → the Agents section.
2. For the `claude` agent, add `--permission-mode auto` to its default arguments.
3. Leave the run mode per-agent: an agent with its own argument override is excluded from the global
   yolo / manual switch, which is what you want — you do not want a global switch deciding a worker's
   permission model.

Two things to know before relying on it:

- The app's own "yolo" mode injects a FIXED flag per agent, and it is NOT an auto permission mode:
  for `claude` it is the skip-permissions flag, for `codex` the bypass-approvals-and-sandbox flag.
  Those are broader than what a worker needs. The auto-mode classifier belongs to Claude Code, not
  to the runtime, and that classifier is the thing worth keeping alive (gotcha G27).
- For any agent other than `claude`, **consult that agent's own documentation** for its equivalent.
  Verified on this machine: OpenCode exposes `--auto` (auto-approve permissions not explicitly
  denied). For Codex, do not guess a flag — read its docs, then write the verified value here.
- **(unverified)** the exact label of the settings section and the field, which may differ per app
  version. Read the screen, do not trust this sentence.

Until that override exists on a machine, a native worker launches in whatever mode the app's
per-agent default gives it, which is the trap gotcha G27 describes. Neither the repo nor a teammate's
machine can tell whether you did it, which is the whole problem with a non-versionable setting.

### 3.2 · direnv, so a supervised worker has credentials

A launch line can export variables; the native launch cannot, because it has no argv. What it has is
Orca's **interactive shell**, and that is the whole seam: with direnv installed and hooked into that
shell, an `.envrc` that sources the repo's env file fires when the worker's terminal opens, and the
worker starts with credentials. Measured 2026-09-17: a direct probe showed
`direnv: export +ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN +ATLASSIAN_EMAIL …` and then the probe variable reading `SET`.

Without direnv, the same command produces a supervised worker with NO credentials **and nothing
reports it**. It fails much later, at its first authenticated call, with an error that reads like a
broken tool (gotcha G45).

```bash
command -v direnv                                # the hook must be installed AND hooked into the shell
cat .envrc                                       # must source the repo's env file; never commit secrets here
direnv allow                                     # once per checkout, per machine
```

Two rules that follow from this being per-machine and invisible:

- The conductor **verifies credentials on the worker's screen** before sending it any work
  (`references/coordinator-playbook.md` §1 step 5). Readiness is not capability.
- `.envrc` is a per-machine convenience, not a repo contract. Nothing in this repo may depend on it
  existing: the custom-argv line loads the env file through the repo's own wrapper instead, and that
  is why the human-paste path needs none of this.

---

## 4 · The setup hook → the provisioning script

```bash
orca repo list --json </dev/null
orca repo show --repo <selector> --json </dev/null     # read the CURRENT setup command + policy
```

Today the registered setup command for this repo installs dependencies only, which covers exactly
one of the seven gaps a fresh worktree has (`references/provisioning.md` §1). Point it at the
provisioning script instead and six close automatically:

- In the app: the repository's settings → the setup script field → `bun run worktree:provision`.
- Keep the setup policy at run-by-default, so a newly created worktree provisions itself before the
  agent starts.

**This setting is UI-only** (gotcha G24): the CLI does not expose it, the machine-readable command
schema has no command for it, and desktop automation is blocked by the OS permission model on
macOS. It cannot be scripted and it cannot be versioned.

---

## 5 · Mobile pairing (optional)

Pairing a phone is what makes "send me the summary on my phone" real: the board card, its comment
and shared artifacts become readable away from the desk, and a blocking question can be answered
from there. The pairing flow lives in the app plus the environment commands
(`orca environment list` / `orca environment add --pairing-code <code>`); the pairing code itself is
issued by the app. Which controls the phone offers over a blocking question is **(unverified)** —
find out during a real fleet, and record it in `references/gotchas.md`.

---

## 6 · The checklist, to copy

```
[ ] binary installed, `orca status` reports a reachable runtime; appVersion noted
[ ] (optional) vendor stubs installed GLOBALLY, never --local in this repo
[ ] Settings -> Agents: `claude` default args include `--permission-mode auto`
    (prerequisite of the SUPERVISED native launch; a pasted custom-argv line needs nothing)
[ ] other agents: their documented equivalent, verified, not guessed
[ ] direnv installed, hooked into the shell, `.envrc` sources the env file, `direnv allow` run
    (the only way a native worker gets credentials; verify on the worker's screen at launch)
[ ] repo setup script set to `bun run worktree:provision`, policy run-by-default
[ ] (optional) phone paired
[ ] a single test worker launched and released end to end BEFORE a real fleet
```

The last line is not decoration. A machine where nobody has ever released a worker is a machine
where the cleanup path is untested, and the cleanup path is the one that takes the runtime down when
it is wrong (gotcha G31).
